## Description

Building a simple book route application. Using an array to store list of the courses.

Our application should have the following routes:

`GET /api/courses` - this should respond with a list of all the courses.

`POST /api/courses` - this route should accept form data and add a course to the list.

`GET /items/:id` - this route should display a single course name and it.

`PATCH /api/courses/:id` - this route should accept edits to existing course.

`DELETE /api/courses/:id` - this route should allow you to delete a specific course from the array.
